Schematic Summary
====================

A quick rundown of the main components shown in the schematics:

- ATSAMC21G (U1) - the main processor on the board. Connected to a 32.768 kHz crystal for accurate timing. 
- NCP1117 (U5) - 5V voltage regulator, linear. The lower the voltage (down to ~7V) applied, the less heat will be generated by this part. Do not apply more than 20V, however the reccomended maximum is 12V.
- LP2985 (U6) - 3.3V voltage regulator, linear. Rated for 150mA. 
- LMV358 (U2) - dual comparator. Half is used to determine whether USB or the barrel jack should supply power, half is used as a buffer on the pin 13 LED. 
- FT231XQ (U4) - FTDI chip. Used to convert serial to USB for communication with a computer.
