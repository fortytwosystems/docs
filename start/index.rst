Get Started
=================================================

Congrats on your purchase of a FortyTwo Systems board! Here's some info on how to get started:

- Unbox your board.
- Plug in your board to a USB-B cable (the kind that usually comes with your printer)
- A green LED should light up, and a yellow LED should slowly fade in and out. This indicates that the board is in bootloader mode and ready to accept your code. 
- Follow the steps on the `Arduino IDE <arduino-ide.html>`_ page to load code onto your board.

Here's some tips to make sure your baord stays safe:

- Make sure you always handle the board by its edges. This will protect the sensitive electronics on the board.
- Never plug in the board while it is on a conductive surface or touching anything metal. This will destroy your board.
