Warranty
-------------------

The FortyTwo Systems warranty is good for 90 days and covers any defect in material or workmanship under 
normal use during the warranty period. We will repair or replace product that is defective due to improper material
or workmanship during normal use at no charge. 

The warranty does not cover damage due to malfunctions or damage not caused by defective material or workmanship.
**You must contact us before sending boards in to be warrantied**.

Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages or allow limitations 
on how long an implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations or exclusions may not apply to you. This warranty 
gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other rights that vary by state to state.
